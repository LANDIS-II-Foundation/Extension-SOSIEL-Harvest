Integration 2.0.0.0 2021-01-05

Key changes:
 - Refactored project layout
 - Upgraded to SOSIEL 3.0
 - Upgraded to CsvHelper 19.0.0
 - Now need to ship following additional assemblies:
   - Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces.dll 
   - Microsoft.Bcl.HashCode.dll

New features:
 - SOSIEL extensions interface (for now only for the goal prioritizing)
 - Added VBGP (Value-Based Goal Prioritizing) extension


Integration 1.0.7.6841 2018-09-24

New features:
 - Added 'MinReductionPercentage' and 'MaxReductionPercentage' outputs


Integration 1.0.6.6374 2017-06-13

New features:
 - Changed output format for 'activated rule values' column (removed parameter name).
 - Changed algorithm: FE agents work with site biomass instead of average site biomass.
 - Changed configuration: antecedent parameter of FE is Biomass


Integration 1.0.5.6363 2017-06-02

New features:
 - Changed anticipatory learning and action selection algorithms.
 - Added activated rule values and total number of rules to the output model.

 Fixed bugs:
 - Fixed the bug in algorithm for checking the possibility of collective action.

Integration 1.0.4.6361 2017-05-31

New features:
 - Changed the formula of normalized difference (Normalized difference = |actual difference / max difference|).
 - Added algorithm of generating new ai values for the new rule.


Integration 1.0.3.6360 2017-05-30

New features:
 - Biomass reduction moved to the SOSIEL algorithm for avoiding biomass reduction differences.


Integration 1.0.2.6359 2017-05-29

New features:
 - Implemented the rule equality checking for avoiding creating a lot of similar rules.
 - Implemented additional cases to calculate normalized difference in goal prioritization method.
