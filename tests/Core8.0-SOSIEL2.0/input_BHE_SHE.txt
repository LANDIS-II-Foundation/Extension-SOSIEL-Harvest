>> HARVESTING PRESCRIPTIONS
>> -------------------------

>>---- G1 PRESCRIPTIONS - ECONOMIC GAIN ---------------------------------------

>> Harvest prescriptions for G1, maximize economic gain through harvesting mature (>/= 50 years) trees of all 4 species.
>> Rank stands by economic value, where each species becomes economically valuable at age 50.
>> Stands must be at least 50 years of age on average (mean max age of all cells in the stand).
>> Stands cannot be re-harvested for at least 20 years.
>> When a stand is selected for harvest, the entire stand is harvested regardless of size.
>> Each harvest prescription has as different designated % of mature biomass harvested while the proportion of the landscape harvested remains at 20%.

>>---- G2 PRESCRIPTIONS - SUSTAINABNILITY ---------------------------------------

>> Thinning prescriptions for G2, maximize sustainability by creating fire resilient stands with mature structure by thinning from below. 
>> Prescription is identical for both management areas at the beginning of the simulation.
>> Stands are ranked using the Regulate Ages function, which aims to create an even distribution of stand ages across each management area.
>> There is no max or min stand age requirement, as we simply want to remove young cohorts and leave mature trees.
>> Stands cannot be re-harvested for at least 20 years.
>> When a stand is selected for harvest, the entire stand is harvested regardless of size.
>> Each thinning prescription is associated with a different percentage of the landscape treated while the percent of immature biomass thinned remains at 80%.
