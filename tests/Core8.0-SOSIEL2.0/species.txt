>> These species are created for the project "Co-evolutionary cognitive- 
>> and knowledge-based decision-making in forest landscapes" by Garry Sotnik, 
>> Brooke A. Cassell, & Robert M. Scheller. There are two conifer species and
>> two hardwood species with a climate-resiliant and a climate-sensitive species
>> in each category.

>> The first conifer species (confsens) is based loosely on Abies balsamea (balsam fir), and is designated a "climate-sensitive" species.
>> (prefers cool climate with consistent moisture, shade tolerant.) He, Mladenoff & Gustafson (2002) projected losses 
>> in abundance under climate warming
>> The second conifer species, (confrslt) is based loosely on  Pinus resinosa (red pine), and is designated a "climate-resilient" species 
>> (shade intolerant, long-lived, south-facing slopes, sandy soil, lower elevations, projected to increase under climate
>> change for up to 100 years before declining (He, Mladenoff & Gustafson 2002).
>> The first hardwood species (brdlsens) is based loosely on Acer saccharum (sugar maple), and is designated a "climate-sensitive" species
>> (prefers cooler climate, shade-tolerant, projected decline by He, Mladenoff & Gustafson 2002).
>> The second hardwood species (brdlrslt) is based loosely on Quercus alba (white oak), and is designated a "climate-resilient"
>> species  - projected increased abundance over 300 years of climate warming (He, Mladenoff & Gustafson 2002).
>> (pioneer species, fire-tolerant, long-lived, no seed dormancy needed, can grow on dry, gravelly slopes.)
